})
//Even though the asyncHandler catches asynchronous errors overall, the try-catch inside verifyJWT is used to customize error handling.
// For example, jwt.verify can throw synchronous errors, and the try-catch lets you catch those errors and wrap them into a custom ApiError with a specific status code/message before letting asyncHandler pass it to Express's middleware. 
// This gives you finer control over the error responses.


//If you remove the try-catch block:
// Any synchronous error (like one thrown by jwt.verify) would bubble up and still be caught by asyncHandler.
// However, you would lose the opportunity to wrap these errors in your custom ApiError with a specific status code and message (e.g., converting a generic JWT error into a 401 "Invalid access token" error).
// Without try-catch, the raw error gets passed on to the next middleware, which might not provide the desired error format or status.
//means we dont have control on the status code and error message , in case any error occur
