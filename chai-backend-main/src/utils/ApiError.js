// When the following line runs:
//throw new ApiError(409, "User with email or username already exists");
// this is what happens:

// The async function in the route throws the ApiError.
// Since the function is wrapped with asyncHandler, the thrown error causes the returned Promise to be rejected.
// The rejection is caught by the .catch((err) => next(err)) in asyncHandler.
// The error is passed to Express's next() function, which then hands it off to the error-handling middleware (custom if defined, otherwise Expressâ€™s default error handler).

//the following happens:
// The error is created as an instance of ApiError, which includes the status code and the message.
// This error is thrown inside an async function wrapped by asyncHandler.
// Within asyncHandler, the promise rejection is caught by the catch block that calls next(err), passing the ApiError instance (including its message) to Express's error-handling middleware.
